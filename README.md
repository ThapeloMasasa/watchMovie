This is a full stack movie platfrom that enables the users to see different types of movies and their trailers. Then the user can view and write reviews
about the movie. They will get displayed in the reviews page.

## Technologies
Since this is a full stack web application I used MongoDB for the database, Java springboot framework for the backend and React for the front end.
